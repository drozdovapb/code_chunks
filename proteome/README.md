scripts for Bedulina et al.
(E. cyaneus male / female proteomes)

The `scripts/` folder contains:
* `eBayes_running_code.R`: code for statistical analysis of the dataset.
* `eBayes_functions.R`: functions used by `eBayes_running_code.R`. Not intended for direct use.
* `add_panther.R`: annotation with Panther families. 
* `GO_new_with_functions.R`: code for Gene Ontology overrepresentation analysis (difference between the predicted and observed proteomes).
* `manual_analysis_figs.R`: handy pieces of code to reproduce plots in the main text. 

The `data` folder contains: 
* Table S1: GO terms obtained with the overrepresentation analysis.
* Table S2: Protein group intensities for each sample (with annotation).
* Table S3: Lists of differentially abundant proteins.
